# Quality-Control-from-raw-materials-Lemon-Juice
This project deals with production of quality product by analysing the quality and quantity parameters (raw materials) of the product. The product is Lemon juice.
I prepared a custom dataset with raw materials that depicts the quality of product. The raw materials are Quantity of Lemons,Sugar,Salt and Plastic(For packing Purpose).
I integrated two models i.e,Image Classification through IBM API and K-Nearest Neighbor Model 
In this,the Image classification model identifies the quality of lemon through image of lemons as input and then classifies it if lemons are of good quality then it checks for quantity of raw materials used for lemon juice production. The KNN classification model finally decides that a quality lemon juice could be prepared from these raw materials or not
The final Output is shown below
